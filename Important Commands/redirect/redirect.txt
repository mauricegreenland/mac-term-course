We use the GREATER THAN > sign to redirect output from one command to another command.

EG: echo "redirect this output to a text file" > newfile.txt

# Redirect will OVERWRITE content of an existing file
# To APPEND the content of a file use the DOUBLE GREATER THAN command >>

EG: echo "append this line to the end of the newfile" >> newfile.txt

EG2: ls -l . >> newtext.txt

# You can cancotonate two files one after another and then redirect the output to a new file
EG3: cat text1.txt text2.txt > file3.txt
