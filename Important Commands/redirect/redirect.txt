We use the GREATER THAN > sign to redirect output from one command to another command.

EG1: echo "redirect this output to a text file" > newfile.txt

We use the LESS THAN < sign to use contents of a file as input to the command

# Redirect will OVERWRITE content of an existing file
# To APPEND the content of a file use the DOUBLE GREATER THAN command >>

EG2: echo "append this line to the end of the newfile" >> newfile.txt

EG3: ls -l . >> newtext.txt

# You can CANCOTONATE two files one after another and then redirect the output to a new file
EG4: cat text1.txt text2.txt > file3.txt

Table:
command > file [Redirection of output]
command >> file [Appends output to specified file]
command < file [Redirection of input]
command 2 > file [Redirection of error messages (stdin, stdout AND stderr are associated with numerical values 0,1,2 - called file descriptors)]

Some examples:

1 - Send the output produced by the WHO command to the file called wholist.txt
who > wholist.txt

2 - To create a file called demo.txt
cat > demo.txt

3 - To run the program myprog taking input from the file called data and sending the output to the file called results
myprog < data.txt >results.txt
